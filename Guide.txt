Flow Project
- Using GraphQL to get data from database
- Buy fish: User register account -> login -> add product to card -> create order -> payment
- Consignment: User upload the product to admin -> waiting to admin approve and give a price -> if agree, accept -> if disagree, cancel
- Consignment Raise: User buy a product -> set a day to take the product -> payment
